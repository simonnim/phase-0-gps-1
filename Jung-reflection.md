What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

The Git concepts I was struggling most with were the push and pull functions to and from Github.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The syntax and how to structure the commands were made much more clear during the GPS. Being able to work through the process with a guide helped to solidify my understanding of Git and Github.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked about how to push and pull using Github but also about the protocol for pairing sessions in general. 

What still confuses you about Git?

While I don't think much confuses me about Git, I do think that I'll have more of an understanding the more I begin to apply the concepts that I learned into the weekly assignments.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first experience of pairing in a GPS was great! Before entering I was a little nervous about where I'd stand in relation to my pair and how that might affect the session, but both the guide and my pair were both very thorough about following the protocol and reviewing the material.
