What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

The git concepts I were struggling with prior would be the the git add function, git push, git push. Mainly how Github worked.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

All the concepts were clarified with Katy and this session. It made a lot of sense after working on it because I was able to see both sides. She clarified about working on branch and if you 'git push' it'll just always push to master and that's not what we wanted. But she was able to make sense of everything.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked about Github and how it worked with git pull and git push. 

What still confuses you about Git?

At this point after the session I feel that everything with Github makes a lot of sense now. Currently with where we are at with Github I feel very comfortable now.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great. I was a bit nervous before getting into this meeting but afterwards I feel that I have learned so much. Having someone skilled watching over us allowed us to make mistakes and allowed them to correct us and explain why we want to do things a certain way. It was awesome. After our guide left we continued working on the last part and completed it, it was great!
